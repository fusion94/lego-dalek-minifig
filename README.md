# LEGO Dalek Minifig

This is a LEGO Dalek Minifig I created awhile back but just modeled in Studio

It was designed using [Stud.io](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) from BrickLink.

### What is Stud.io?
Stud.io is a desktop application that allows users to build LEGO models using virtual parts. Users will have the freedom to build anything they want with any LEGO part. By being integrated with the BrickLink catalog, Stud.io can do things like showing you what part colors are unavailable and letting you keep track of part costs. Stud.io also makes it easy to turn a finished creation into a wanted list that you can use to order through BrickLink.

Stud.io is completely free to use and runs on both Windows and Mac. Although a BrickLink account is not necessary to run Stud.io, registered users will have the added bonus of being able to build with friends in real-time.
